# **Generating EJScreen RMP Facility Proximity**

EJScreen uses Apache Hadoop pig scripts to generate Risk Program Management (RMP) facility proximity. The Pig scripts were developed using Esri's [GIS Toolkit for Hadoop](https://esri.github.io/gis-tools-for-hadoop/) toolkit. It was run in an AWS EMR cluster environment. The source data came directly from EPA's RMP database with all active sites. The proximity process involves Pre-Hadoop processing, running Hadoop Pig scripts, and Post-Hadoop processing. The end results are Census block-group based proximity scores.

**Pre-Hadoop Processing:**

- Create a geodatabase table RMP_Work.gdb based on the download dataset (RMP_021623.csv).
- Drop records outside the 50 states, DC and PR, and create table RMP\_021623\_forHadoop.
- Export records to RMP\_021623\_forHadoop.csv with these columns: EPA\_ID, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, CWEIGHT. Note that EPA\_ID is PGM\_SYS\_ID from the Envirofacts source file and CWEIGHT = 1 for all records.

**AWS Hadoop Processing:**

- Start an AWS EMR cluster.
- Rather than doing 52 separate state runs, combine the states into 22 state groupings.
- Run Step 1 for each of 22 state groups to generate weighted distances facility-block pairs. See **RMP\_US01\_02\_72\_proximity\_Step1.txt** for Pig script example.
- Run Step 2 for each of 22 state groups to generate block group summary for each subgroup. See **RMP\_US01\_02\_72\_proximity\_Step2.txt** for Pig script example.
- Use Athena to create BG-level results tables and download as csv files, for example, BG\_Scores\_01.csv to OutputfromHadoop folder.
- Repeat all steps for each state group.

**Post-Hadoop Processing:**

- Combine all BG score text files in OutputfromHadoop folder into one file (RMP\_BG\_Scores\_US.csv).
- Open RMP_BG_Scores.csv in a text editor to capitalize the header and remove all other header rows. 
- Import US csv file to Excel; make sure BLKGRP is text.
- Add the Excel file to the geodatabase (RMP\_Work.gdb) as a new table (RMP\_BG\_Scores\_US).
- Add US\_RMPProx\_BG with BG shapes and BG\_SCORE, set NULL Scores to 0.
